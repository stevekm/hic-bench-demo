# Demo HiC-Bench ChIP-Seq Pipeline

designed for use in NYU Langone Medical Center

This demo will walk you through the setup for a ChIP-Seq analysis. See more docs for this pipeline [here](https://github.com/NYU-BFX/hic-bench/tree/master/pipelines/chipseq-standard).

# Installation

## HiC-Bench

Make sure you've got [HiC-Bench](https://github.com/NYU-BFX/hic-bench) installed. This is typically installed in your home directory. 

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/NYU-BFX/hic-bench.git
```

If you're working on the phoenix server at NYU, make sure you have your `data` directory linked to Aris's.

```
cd hic-bench
ln -s /ifs/home/at570/disk1/Resources/Code/pipeline-master/data data
```

- __NOTE:__ you might have to delete the broken `data` symlink before you can reset it.

- __NOTE:__ This guide was designed using the latest HiC-Bench version at commit id `f3d7a306aebaa5a3dfbcdcebc83a4ccedc513ccd`. If newer version have changed compatibility with this demo, you can go back to that version of HiC-Bench by running:
```
cd hic-bench
git checkout f3d7a306aebaa5a3dfbcdcebc83a4ccedc513ccd
```
before proceeding with the rest of the demo.

## This Demo

Clone this demo repository, and change to its directory

```
git clone https://github.com/stevekm/hic-bench-demo.git
cd hic-bench-demo
```


# Usage

From within this directory, make a new directory for the analysis, and start a new HiC-Bench analysis there:

```
mkdir sample-project
~/hic-bench/code/code.main/pipeline-new-analysis chipseq-standard sample-project
```

Change to that directory:

```
cd sample-project
```

and finish pipeline setup; 

- set input files

```
code/setup-sample-files.sh ../source_data/
```

- create sample sheet template from samples, supplying genome version and fragment size

```
cd inputs/
code/create-sample-sheet.tcsh hg19 400
```

- __MANUALLY__ open the `inputs/sample-sheet.tsv` file (e.g. in Excel, etc.) and match up the Input samples with the experimental samples. Refer to the [samplesheet](https://github.com/stevekm/hic-bench-demo/tree/master/example_samplesheet) provided with this repository for an example of what it should look like. 

- run the pipeline

```
# need to be in the parent analysis dir
cd ..
code.main/pipeline-execute sample-project yourname@emailaddress.org
```
